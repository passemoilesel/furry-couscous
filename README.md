# furry-couscous
An experiment in learning SQL, Git, Bash & Python.

This is a place where I put stuff I like, that works, that's cleverly designed and well, that works.

Some of it is my own creation (use at your own risk!), some of it is stuff I found on the Interwebs that get the job done and taught me something new.

If you're ok with that, feel free to use it and modify it. I claim no credit.

If you're not ok with that, gentle reader, pass by.
